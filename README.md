## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0
- Docker (for development environment)

### Development Setup

#### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy environment files:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

3. Start development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend (NestJS) and frontend (React + Vite) servers concurrently.

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:3000/api/docs

#### Default Credentials

On first run, a default admin user is automatically created:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Email**: `admin@rancherhub.local`
- **Password**: `admin123`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notice**: You will be required to set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on first login. Please change the default password immediately after logging in!

#### Option 2: Docker Development

1. Start with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start all services including PostgreSQL database.

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173  
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

The default admin credentials (admin/admin123) will work for Docker setup as well.
