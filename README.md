  - Backup codes for account recovery
  - Enable/disable 2FA with verification
- **User Administration**: Complete user lifecycle management
  - Create and manage multiple users
  - Set active/inactive status
  - Track user activity and login history
  - User statistics and monitoring
- **Password Management**: Secure password change functionality for all users
- **Protected Routes**: All application routes are protected and require authentication

### üîÑ ConfigMap Synchronization & Comparison

Powerful ConfigMap management across environments:

- **Visual Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of ConfigMaps between any two app instances

- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for complex multi-cluster, multi-environment setups

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0
- Docker (for development environment)

### Development Setup

#### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy environment files:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

3. Start development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend (NestJS) and frontend (React + Vite) servers concurrently.

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:3000/api/docs

#### Default Credentials

On first run, a default admin user is automatically created:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Email**: `admin@rancherhub.local`
- **Password**: `admin123`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Notice**: You will be required to set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on first login. Please change the default password immediately after logging in!

#### Option 2: Docker Development

1. Start with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start all services including PostgreSQL database.

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173  
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

The default admin credentials (admin/admin123) will work for Docker setup as well.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Ant Design
- **Backend**: NestJS + TypeScript + TypeORM + SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **State Management**: Zustand + React Query
- **Authentication**: 
  - JWT-based user authentication
  - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with TOTP
  - Rancher API tokens for cluster access
- **Security**: 
  - bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
  - Protected API routes with JWT guards
  - Mandatory 2FA for all users

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend in development mode
- `npm run build` - Build both applications for production
- `npm run test` - Run tests for both applications
- `npm run lint` - Lint both applications

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories based on the `.env.example` files.

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started with User Management

1. **Initial Login**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173
   - Log in with default credentials (admin/admin123)
   - You'll be prompted to set up 2FA immediately

2. **Setting up 2FA**:
   - Scan the QR code with your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
   - Enter the 6-digit code to verify
   - Save your backup codes in a secure location

3. **Managing Users**:
   - Navigate to "User Management" in the sidebar
   - View user statistics and list of all users
   - Create new users with username, email, and password
   - Edit user information or deactivate users
   - Delete users when necessary

4. **User Settings**:
   - Click on your username in the top-right corner
   - Change password from the dropdown menu
   - Enable/disable 2FA (requires verification)

### Using ConfigMap Diffs

1. **Setup Prerequisites**:
   - Configure at least one Rancher site
   - Create environments (e.g., Dev, Staging, Production)
   - Set up app instances linking environments to clusters/namespaces

2. **Compare ConfigMaps**:
   - Navigate to "ConfigMap Diffs" in the sidebar
   - Select source app instance (e.g., Production)
   - Select target app instance (e.g., Staging)
   - Click "Compare" to view differences

3. **Review Differences**:
   - View summary statistics (total, identical, different, missing)
   - Browse the comparison table with status indicators:
     - üü¢ **Identical**: ConfigMaps are the same
     - üîµ **Different**: ConfigMaps exist but have different values
     - üü† **Missing in Target**: ConfigMap exists in source but not in target
     - üî¥ **Missing in Source**: ConfigMap exists in target but not in source

4. **Sync Configuration**:
   - Click "Details" on any ConfigMap to view key-by-key comparison
   - Review individual key differences
   - Select keys to sync using checkboxes
   - Click "Sync Selected Keys" to synchronize multiple keys
   - Or click "Sync" on individual keys for single-key updates

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Always review changes before syncing
   - Use copy-to-clipboard feature to backup values
   - Compare Production ‚Üí Staging before promoting changes
   - Check sync history for audit trail

### Managing Services

1. Navigate to "Services" to view all services from configured app instances
2. Filter services by environment or app instance
3. Select services and choose target environment
4. Click "Sync" to synchronize service configurations
5. Review sync history for operation details
